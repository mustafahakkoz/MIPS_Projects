## project-1: Problems and Solutions  

In this project, we were required to implement some procedures in MIPS assembly language. We 
used SPIM simulator to develop and test our code. There are three questions which are unrelated:

**First question**, A sequence of square root approximation with a given length,  
**Second question**, Matrix multiplication,  
**First question**, Palindrome checker,  
**Bonus question**, Main Menu.  

Implementation details can be found in project manual and report.
